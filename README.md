# TPN-Low-Level-Framework
TPN's low level C framework.

This framework will include several source files that contains basic low level C functions. Those functions have nothing to do with proper network stuff, but they are essentiel for both the client and the server to run smoothly.

Functions will be segregated according to what field they belong to. For each of them, documentation has to be exhaustive, and contain at least one call example.
